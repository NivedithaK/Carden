## Practices
### Practices we should continue

* Full participation in standups from every member
* Asking clarifying questions from our mentors

### Practices we want to do next sprint

* Properly plan our sprint formally in a proper sprint planning document
* Starting sprint 2 user stories
* Don't start big parts of the sprint two days before it's due
* Have at least two people on the same story with subtasks divided up
* Breakdown user stories so they are smaller and more reasonable to complete

### Practices that were harmful and should be stopped

* 10AM meetings
* Overnight work without sleep

## Experience
### Best Experiences

* Learning new technologies
* Using Chakra-UI

### Worst Experiences

* Not being clear on how to use Jira subtasks and deleting descriptions by accident
* Not assigning subtasks properly during the sprint
* Being inexperienced in the area that a task requires
* Poor directory structure, if any
* Procrastinating and doing a lot of work before the deadline
* Having too much accumulated work from all courses around the deadline, especially CS courses
