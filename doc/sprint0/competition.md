There are many existing websites that provide a platform to customize and send personalized e-cards. All of the 
sites below provide card templates for a variety of different occasions (e.g. birthday, Christmas, Valentine ’s 
Day). The type of templates they provide are listed below.

The following sites provide e-card template videos to choose from. These videos consist of an animation containing 
text, pictures, and/or music the user has uploaded. They allow users to customize the text and images displayed 
during the video; however, users cannot modify the video animation played.

The next two sites allow users design to design their e-card however they like, either starting with a template 
or a blank canvas. There is an animation that plays of the card exiting an envelope and being opened. No other 
interactions or animations.

This next site offers e-card templates with interactive elements (e.g. clicking on balloons to pop them). Only a 
few fields can be personalized (e.g. text field or photo field).

All of the above websites allow users to modify existing card templates and some of them allow users to create 
their own templates from scratch; however, user creations are not featured on these sites. User designs can only 
be shared through email or social media. In addition, while some of the sites above allow users to create their 
own templates with photos and text boxes, none of them provide tools to make cards intractable or to animate objects. 
Our product will both feature user creations and provide tools for users to add intractability to their cards. 

Our product is better for two types of users: users who want to completely customize the intractability of their cards 
and creators share their creation with the community. 

Potential reasons why competitors did not allow users to share their creations with the rest of the platform:
•	The majority of user created templates would be of lower quality than the cards created/approved by the 
        organization
•	There is already a wide enough variety of cards created/approved by the organization to cover every occasion
•	Would require a voting/ranking system to filter user created templates
•	Would require moderation to remove any inappropriate or duplicate posts

Potential reasons why competitors do not provide tools to animate cards or change existing animations and/or 
interactions:
•	The vast majority of users do not want to meddle with the animations; they like the existing templates
•	Creating an editor that supports adding intractable elements/animations would be too difficult to implement 
        or too unwieldy for the average user
•	Other software exists that provides users with the tools to create animations
