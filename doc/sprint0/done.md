# Done

User Stories are considered done when they have met the following criteria. As done applies to all User Stories, we must confirm that the program written: functions as intended, is linted, and is tested thoroughly. Programs also require proper documentation for internal use and future development. If a User Story meets these criteria, it is considered done.
