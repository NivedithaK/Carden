## Teamwork and Organization

We organized the team by discussing our past experience, goals for learning, and strengths in terms of software development, after our discussion we
decided on the following tentative role distribution:

```Text
Backend (NodeJS, Express):
- Deval
- Mathieu
- George
- Puneet

Backend (Routing and API, ExpressJS):
- Deval
- Mathieu
- George
- Puneet
- Raza

Backend (Authentication and Registration, NodeJS, Redux, MongoDB):
- Deval
- Raza

Database (MongoDB):
- Deval
- Raza

Frontend (React):
- Emily
- Nivy

Frontend UI/UX (Figma):
- Nivy
- Emily

Frontend UI/UX (Material React UI, React):
- Nivy
- Emily
- Deval
- Raza

Security:
- Nivy
- Emily
```

The role distributions represent roles we are comfortable working in, and roles we would like to learn more about.
Each person with the specified role is the lead in the role, however we do allow for everyone to work in other areas
with the help of the role leads.

Some of our members have worked together in the past and the overlap in teams we have worked on previously resulted in the
formation of our group. We primarily use Discord as our communication method of choice as we are all very active on the platform.
We also use our emails for meeting scheduling, and Google Drive for collaborative group work, notes, and brainstorming.

## Decision Making

We employed the use of Google Sheets to create categories/topics to vote on by giving a score out of 5 to each option reflecting
our desire to work on the project/agreement with option. We took the top 3 options and re voted on those 3 to select the final
topic.

We used discord to take polls on questions about meeting times/dates, and general questions using a thumbsup reaction to signify "Yes"
and a thumbsdown to signify a "No".

For user story priority and ranking decisions we used google sheets once again to provide the priority level that we
individually believe the user story should have. We used a point scoring system and tallied our points on google sheets for review.
The point scoring and process is described in the next section.

## Priority of User Stories

We used the fibonnaci sequence as the points scoring system. The higher the number in the complexity column, the more complex
and difficult the user story is. Similarly, the higher the number in the priority column, the more important the user story
is and the earlier it must be implemented for our product. Each group member scores each user story with this scoring scheme,
ranking both the priority and complexity of the user story.

User stories which are required for user functionality such as browsing cards, creating cards, and publishing cards, are the most
important user stories.

User stories for functionalities such as logging in are less important as the main focus is on anyone being
able to create and publish cards.

We spent 2 rounds of voting to decide the point estimates for the user stories. First round
for the bulk of the voting, and the second to finalize the points.

## Frequency of Meetings

We have mandatory meetings on Wednesdays which encompass all the main topics/issues we encounter as we work during the week.
We also have daily standup meetings in which we discuss what we are currently working on so everyone can discuss their progress and
whether or not they require help.

## Lessons

A spreadsheet is an excellent tool to gauge our votes on topics. Voice Calls + screen sharing are excellent for clear communication.
We have members who have prior experience with certain technologies and/or processes and having their input in choosing certain tech
and working on certain processes has made things much more efficient. It's also much better to work on certain items with a partner
not only to divide work but also compare ideas.
