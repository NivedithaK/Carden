### Unfinished tasks as new user stories

This section may undergo changes on Jira.

These stories are unchanged on Jira so far.

## Practices
### Practices we should continue

* Have reasonably sized stories
* Showing up to meetings

### Practices we want to do next sprint

* Stop saying that we should do things early and actually start doing things early.
* Admit that we're going to start late. 
* Maybe do the all-nighters earlier.
* Set due dates other than the sprint deadline; perhaps have a friday showcase between group members only

### Practices that were harmful and should be stopped

* Pulling all-nighters right before the deadline.
* Figure out which stories are dependent on each other more clearly and earlier, so people don't end up being blocked. (schedule.pdf)
  * Perhaps have two deadlines: finish all important things that don't depend on something within 1 week, finish the dependent things within the second week.

## Experience
### Best Experiences

* All-nighters ðŸ˜‚; it didn't feel lonely 
* Finally getting things to work (like the server)
* Increased understanding of tools and technologies; Understanding JavaScript code better
* Not coding alone, being able to ask for help
* Seeing the canvas integration and load/store

### Worst Experiences

* Trying to handle the work from CSC301 A2 being due around sprint due date.

* Panicking over possible broken features right before the sprint 3 demo; unmerged work, broken in develop 
* Dealing with using React
* npm not working
* Seeing that the profile page ended up being broken somehow (crashed back-end and front-end)
