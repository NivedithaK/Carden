## Unfinished Tasks and New User Stories
### Unfinished

* **WEEB-4** As anyone, I can use a pre-existing template to create a card
  * **WEEB-24** Allow user to edit the template
* **WEEB-31** As a user I want to be able to place a component at position x, y and store it to make template unique
  * **WEEB-74** Link frontend and backend to store templates
* **WEEB-71** As a user, I want to have a nice user interface and experience when using the canvas editor
  * **WEEB-73** Create the React component (front-end) for this story
* **WEEB-8** As a registered user, I want my card to be hosted on the site for viewing purposes
* **WEEB-13** As a registered user, I want to be able to save and access my older cards for later use

### Unfinished tasks as new user stories

This section may undergo changes on Jira.

These stories are unchanged on Jira so far.

## Practices
### Practices we should continue

* Doing a good job
* Keep doing meetings and contribute to the conversation
* Balance workload better

### Practices we want to do next sprint

* Take down notes of everything we're talking about; Completing sprintN.md at the start of the sprint.
* Figure out the schedule.pdf at the start of the sprint instead
* Add all the user stories to Jira first; terminate Jira user stories when they are actually finished
* Collaborate more/better due to user stories being dependent on each other.

### Practices that were harmful and should be stopped

* Procrastinating
* Delaying Pull-Request Reviews

## Experience
### Best Experiences

* Like flipping to the dark mode
* Making memes with the new canvas editor; using the editor
* Making friends
* Being helped and getting proper reviews of work I am not familiar with 
* TA always helps us out and vibes with us.
* Mobile-friendly deployed website felt great
* Being able to deploy the website

### Worst Experiences

* Dislike of React semantics
* Trying to figure out something in React but not figuring out something for hours
* Causing massive git conflicts with a request
* Problems with a-sync promises in React
* Finding x and y components of elements (this is still difficult)
* The troubles that come with deploying a website
