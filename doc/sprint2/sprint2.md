# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting
**Requirements**: Meeting and sprint goal is documented, all spikes clearly identified, team capacity recorded, participants are recorded, everyone has participated, decisions about user stories to be completed this sprint are clear, tasks breakdown is done.

**Date**: 02/17/21

**Participants** [Full Attendance]: Deval, Puneet, Raza, Georges, Matthieu, Emily, Nivy

## **Sprint Goal**
Complete the most important features and deploy. See [User Stories To Be Completed](#user-stories-to-be-completed). 

## **Spikes (Difficult and hard-to-estimate user stories)**

**TODO** - The below content is taken from sprint1.md
* Storing cards in the database
  * This is a spike because there are multiple ways we could do this, and we need to do more research before making a decision. For example, we could create React components for the cards and then serialize and de-serialize them. Or, we could store the props of each subcomponent in the card, and then reconstruct the card when itâ€™s time for the card to be viewed. 
* Canvas editor
  * This is a spike because the difficulty depends on whether we can find a React component that does most of the work for us. Also, we need to figure out how to convert the output of the canvas into a template component. Finally, we need to figure out how to store templates in our database. For example, they could be stored the same way as cards (e.g. serialized), or (more likely) templates might need a different schema indicating which of its elements are editable. 

## **Team capacity**

7 people * 2 hours a day (assuming other coursework and lecture) * 10 days (not counting weekends) = 140 hours.
